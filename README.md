# University of Michigan Lecture Downloads

The scripts included here enable University of Michigan-affiliated individuals to download lectures from the Lecture Capture system ([leccap.engin.umich.edu](https://leccap.engin.umich.edu)). 

As ITS does not make any promises about how long course recordings are retained, downloading content is the best way to ensure that you can access it whenever you want. As of May 2024, course recordings seem to be preserved for at least three years. 

Note that the [CAEN website](https://caen.engin.umich.edu/lecrecording/students/) states that:
> Students who wish to obtain video file downloads of lecture recordings must contact their course instructors directly. Only the instructors of a course may authorize download access.

As such, please contact the instructors of any courses you wish to download before using these scripts. 

## Overview 
The Python script in [`mass-download/`](/mass-download/) enables users to download **any subset** of lectures from **any number of courses**. This script should take no more than five minutes to set up and run (although the actual downloads may take far longer).

Credit goes to [@ajaypillay](https://github.com/ajaypillay) for inspiring this project. A (slightly modified) version of his original script can be found in [`one-off-script/`](/one-off-script/). This script can be run in the browser console and enables users to download all the lectures for a single course.

Note that a single 85-minute lecture video takes about 400 MB to store; please ensure you have enough storage availablle before using these scripts.
